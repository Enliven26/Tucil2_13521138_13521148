# NEAREST POINTS | Tugas Kecil 2 IF2211 Strategi Algoritma
Nearest Points is a program that find a pair of points with closest Euclidean distance among other possible pairs in a list of points. User can input the length of the list (N) and the dimension that each point has (M). The program will generate N random points in M dimension and find the nearest pair among them. The program will try to compare the result from Divide and Conquer approach with Brute Force apporach.

## Requirements
1. Python installation
